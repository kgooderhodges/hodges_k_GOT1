# When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die. There is no middle ground.

## Peace is over in the Seven Kingdoms, winter is coming and Dragons exist once more. 
### The ruling families of the Seven Kingdoms have many secrets and more than enough skeletons in their closets.

## Select the house sigil to immerse yourself into your house and learn more about them, but don't be shocked by what you learn.
### If you think this has a happy ending, you havenâ€™t been paying attention.
